2. **API Key Issues**
   - Check your `.env` file has the correct `GROQ_API_KEY`
   - Verify the API key is valid and has sufficient credits

3. **Poor Response Quality**
   - Enable debug mode to see search results
   - Check chunk quality scores in the debug information
   - Consider reprocessing the knowledge base

### Performance Tips

1. **For Better Responses**
   - Use specific, detailed questions
   - Enable session memory for follow-up questions
   - Check debug mode to understand search results

2. **For Faster Processing**
   - Use specific data sources (PDF only or web only)
   - Adjust relevance threshold in debug mode
   - Clear session history if it gets too long
