# University Assistant Bot Improvements

## Accuracy Enhancements

### Embedding Model Upgrade
- Upgraded from all-MiniLM-L6-v2 to BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5
- Better semantic understanding for more accurate matching
- Implemented proper embedding normalization for cosine similarity
- Changed from L2 distance to cosine similarity for better matching precision

### Chunking Strategy Optimization
- PDF Documents: Reduced chunk size to 500 characters with 200 character overlap
- Fee Structure Documents: Smaller 400 character chunks for better handling of tabular data
- Web Content: Optimized 600 character chunks with 200 character overlap
- These parameters provide better context preservation while maintaining focus

### Relevance Filtering
- Implemented a relevance threshold mechanism (default 0.65)
- Automatically filters out low-relevance chunks to prevent hallucinations
- Added relevance scores to chunk metadata for debugging
- User-configurable threshold in debug mode

### Content Generation Guardrails
- Stricter system instructions to prevent hallucinations
- Lower temperature setting (0.2) for more factual, precise responses
- Implemented safety settings to avoid problematic content
- Added pre-response context checks for sufficient relevance
- Post-generation verification and refinement for uncertain responses

## User Experience Improvements

### Debug Mode
- Added toggle to enable/disable debug mode
- Shows retrieved chunks and their relevance scores
- Displays detailed information about retrieval process
- Allows adjustment of relevance threshold in real-time

### Better Feedback
- Improved error messages when information isn't available
- Clear warning when retrieved information isn't sufficiently relevant
- More helpful suggestions for rephrasing questions

### Automated Processing
- Created update_and_run.bat script for one-click updates and startup
- Streamlined installation and setup process

## Technical Improvements

### Context Organization
- Context sorted by relevance score for prioritizing the most relevant information
- Both source type and relevance shown in the context
- Smarter aggregation of similar chunks

### Session Memory Optimization
- Better handling of query history with automatic summarization
- Optimized token usage for longer conversations
- Added relevance scoring to conversation context

### Performance
- Implemented more efficient searching with the IndexFlatIP index
- Optimized initial retrieval count with filtering
